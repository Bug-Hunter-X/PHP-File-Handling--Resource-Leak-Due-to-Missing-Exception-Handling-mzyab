```php
$file = fopen("path/to/file.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle error
    echo "Error opening file.";
}
```
This code is vulnerable because it doesn't properly handle potential errors during file processing.  The `fclose()` function will only be called if the file opens successfully. If an error occurs *during* file processing (e.g., a read error), the file handle might remain open, leading to resource leaks and potential issues for subsequent operations.
